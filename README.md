  We are in the middle of a global pandemic that has basically brought the world to a halt and claimed the lives of thousands of people. Coronavirus is incredibly contagious and has spread at an unprecedented rate. The goal of our project was to better understand the local factors which most contribute to the spread of the virus in an area.
  We manually collected data from multiple sources to build a dataset which contains information on many factors for different locations. We determined which factors these will be by looking at things that usually contribute to the spread of other infectious diseases. We then trained a multivariable linear regression model on this data to find the importance of each attribute. We used this to determine which of the factors contribute most to the spread of COVID-19. For variables which were assigned high importance or piqued our interest, we utilized basic data visualization techniques to further explore the data. Hopefully, in doing this, we can gain insight into what features of a region support and hurt the spread of COVID-19.
